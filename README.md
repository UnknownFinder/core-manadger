# core-manager
It's a simple script witch will control your CPU load by uniform distribution processes per each core of CPU.
So, to available script's work, just download the repository, go to repo-directory and run installer.sh with sudo. It will create a simple daemon, which will run the script task-manager.sh
The task-mamager.sh script contains a algorithms of looking for max and min load on each core and set heavy task from max-loaded core to min-loaded core. You can check the script for fun or for commits.
I will be happy to have the feedback.
